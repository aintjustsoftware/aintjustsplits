* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)-enriched notes for sections, so you never forget to do important things during the run. You can put formatted text, links, images, tables and many more.
* UI was designed with streamers in mind: the left part of app may be streamed to your viewers as it contains the most important statistics, while the right one should help you to successfully complete runs.

* Import and export (incl. `.lss` file import)
* Various customization options
* UI improvements + new themes
